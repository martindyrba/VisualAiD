***Model: Resnet**
Data: All the data-sets > gray matter crops  
***Data Aug: 1/3rd data as it is || 2/3rd of data is shifted (by 7 voxels) in either one of the three dimentions or is flipped.***
Activation: Relu
Cross Validation: 10 Fold
**Adam learning rate: 0.0001**

Training setup: callbacks=[EarlyStopping(monitor='loss', mode='auto', verbose=1, patience=3, min_delta=0.01),    
                      ModelCheckpoint(filepathbest, monitor='loss', verbose=0, save_best_only=True, mode='auto')],       
i.e.  Train by tracking training loss.  
      Validation mertics are standalone. Validation set is not used to optimise training.
